The solar dashboard works only with Outback solar equipment right now. Namely the Outback Mate 3. I'd be happy to support your favorite solar equipment if you want to buy me some to play with. ;)  

Pros over Optics RE:  
1. Works with older MX60 without a firmware update -- See your solar pv watt curve without taking your system out of service and sending the charge controller in for repair.  
2. Designed using bootstrap - looks great on your mobile phone (tested with an iPhone 6S Plus)  

I designed this to work with my system:  
Outback VFXR3648A (2)  
Outback Mate3  
Outback HUB10.3  
Outback MX80 Charge Controller  
Outback MX60 Charge Controller  


You might have to adjust some of the code to work with your system. With only a few minor code changes this dashboard should work with your system.

Get started by copying the config.sample.js to config.js and tune appropriately then run "node app.js" and you should be in business.
